# Docs

Welcome to the `nakala-lang` documentation website.
This is _not_ meant to be a robust and incredibly practical.
I have no desire to maintain a programming langauge with a strict API/ABI/anything that makes it not fun to work on. 
This is purely for documenting some of the features that exist in nakala - and talk about why I think they are cool.
