        <div>
          <p>Nakala only has two core values:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>The syntax should feel familiar, while remaining unique</li>
            <li>
              Nakala doesn't try to do anything really hard, as I want to make
              working on this project fun and not another job that ends up
              burning me out. That doesn't mean it doesn't have cool ideas and
              features though!
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h3 className="font-righteous font-light text-3xl -mt-1">Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>First class functions</li>
          <li>First class classes</li>
          <li>Static type checking</li>
          <li>High performance interpreter (written in Rust ðŸ¦€)</li>
          <li>
            Full-featured javascript interpeter via WASM (try the Playground!)
          </li>
          <li>Pretty error messages</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="font-righteous font-light -mt-1 text-3xl">Planned Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Multi-file support via Modules</li>
          <li>FFI support</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          I am always welcoming PRs and would love to work on the project with
          other people if they are interested. There are no rules, and I will
          accept any PR as long as it aligns with the projects core values as
          described above.
