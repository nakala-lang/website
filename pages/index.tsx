              working on this project fun and not another job that ends up
              burning me out. That doesn't mean it doesn't have cool ideas and
              features though!`}

          Contributing
        </h3>
        <p>
          I am always welcoming PRs and would love to work on the project with
          other people if they are interested. There are no rules, and I will
          accept any PR as long as it aligns with the projects core values as
          described above.

          {`Nakala started as a programming language that I built based on `}
          <a href="https://arzg.github.io/lang/" className="text-blue-500" target="_blank">{"arzg's Eldiro blog posts"}</a>.
          {`The core architecture (especially the parser) was
          practically identical to Eldiro, hence the name of the project: nakala
          (Punjabi for mimic). If you haven't read through his blog posts, I
          highly recommend you do because it is an unmatched learning resource.`}
          <br /><br/>
          {`I ended up scrapping the entire language and codebase for
          something I built from the ground up after studying more. However, I
          decided to keep the name as a nod to arzg for lighting a spark in me
          that put me on a journey of learning constantly.`}
